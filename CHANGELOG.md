### Added

- Terminal-native ROS 2 observation and interaction architecture with a robot-side agent and developer-side CLI/TUI clients.

- Feature-gated QUIC transport for remote agent/client communication, including self-signed certificate support.
- ROS 2 bridge subscriptions for configured topics using supported message types: odometry, twist, string, joint state, and ROS log messages.

- CLI commands for listing topics, listing nodes, and echoing live topic data.
- Ratatui terminal UI with Topics, Nodes, Log, and Joints tabs.
- URDF-aware joint display with joint state updates, limits, command publishing, and configured pose execution support.
